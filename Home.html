	<h3>Wisdom</h3>
		<body>

			<p>Wisdom is one of those characteristics that is hard to define because it includes so much,
			 but that people usually recognise when they encounter it. And most obviously it is found 
			 in the field of decision-making.
			 </p>

			 <p>Wise people generally share an optimism that the problems of life can be solved and that in facing difficult
			  decisions they experience a certain amount of calm. Intelligence may be necessary for wisdom, but it is definitely
			  not enough; its growth also contributes to the ability to see the big picture, a sense of proportion, intellectual 
			  humility, and considerable introspection.
			 </p>

			 <p>Wisdom can only be obtained through experience, but experience does not automatically confer wisdom on its own. The social, emotional , and cognitive processes that transmute experience into wisdom continue to be tested by researchers.
